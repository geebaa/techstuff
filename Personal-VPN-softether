On performamce , Running in openvpn clone mode gives better thruput than L2TP/IPSEC

Enable UDP dest port 1194

to use native l2tp/ipsec psk
=============================
sudo iptables -I INPUT 7  -p udp --dport 500 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 8  -p udp --dport 4500 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 9  -p 50 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 10 -p 51 -j ACCEPT
