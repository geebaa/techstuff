Possible failues 
================
1) When in installation , >>> deploy could fail in "Making file system (ext4) " .. Likely you can reboot and open linux deploy again and it would succeed .
Else make sure the # access shows up on the top... The application needs to have root access 

2) Importing from tar.gz failed ... Again try rebooting ...
